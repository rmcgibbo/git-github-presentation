Keynote and exported pdf file. ~15 slides

use as you wish under CC share alike.

Random Notes
------------

- DVCS (git, hg) is fundamentally a little different than SVN/CVS. there is
  no single central repository at all times. every "local" copy git working
  directory is actually equal.
  - everything is forkable
- on github, the focus is on the code. just look at the very first page. the code
is front and center. CODE IS KING
- compare this to simtk (or sourceforge / google code). when you sign in,
  you see a project description page. you need to navigate to view the code.
- github is for the developers. its not really for the users.
  - this is a nice complementarity with SimTk.org in some ways
- github is extremely well executed. it's easy to use.
